# alerts-and-monitoring-on-a-bank-web-app
Objective
In this project, I workED with popular open-source monitoring and alerting tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack. My goal was to set up an end-to-end monitoring and alerting system for your infrastructure.
Key Guidelines
Leverage Open-Source Tools
Utilize Prometheus for metrics collection, Grafana for visualization, and the ELK stack for log management and analysis.

Custom Monitoring Dashboard
Create a custom monitoring dashboard that provides insights into key system performance metrics. Include visualizations for CPU usage, memory consumption, disk space, and error code occurrences.

Alerting Configuration
Implement at least two metrics-based alerts to notify you of critical system performance issues proactively. Optionally, set up two log-based alerts to detect and respond to specific events in your logs.

Log Streaming to ELK
Stream your logs to the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) to enable efficient log analysis and visualization. Ensure that log data is readily available for troubleshooting and auditing.
